## Explanation
I created a basic webpage for the DALI Developer Challenge. 
I started this challenge with absolutely no idea how to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but I came out of it with a website that I'm proud of.
It was super overwhelming to start, but once I started researching CSS and HTML, I stumbled across a Youtube video by Kevin Powell which walked me through the steps on how to create a website.
Without his help, I would have been lost. He is a fantastic teacher and I learned so much about HTML and CSS just from his video. 
Fortunately, I was able to follow his tutorial and get myself started. Once I began figuring out the language, however, I started taking over and started thinking about how I could add my own twist to the website that reflected my personality.
I started changing the colors, the pictures, and my own spin on transitions and transformations. That was when the fun really started for me. To pick up the language and use it to create things my way.
I struggled a bit using transitions, but I was able to figure it out over time by testing different numbers and finding patterns in previous usages of transitions.
I am so proud of this because it is something that seemed so overwhelming and un-doable. I put in a lot of time and effort, and it paid off. To see the result is the best reward I could have received from this application.
